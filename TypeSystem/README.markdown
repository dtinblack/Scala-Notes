### Thanks

[Chapter 3: Types](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/03-types.html#paths) - specification of the Scala language describes some of the different types with examples.

[On Understanding Types,
Data Abstraction, and Polymorphism](http://lucacardelli.name/papers/onunderstanding.a4.pdf) - paper discusses the notion of <i>type</i>.

[Type Classes as Objects and Implicits](https://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~bruno/papers/TypeClasses.pdf) - describes in detail the theory behind <i>type classes</i> in Scala and includes a discussion about <i>implicits</i>.
