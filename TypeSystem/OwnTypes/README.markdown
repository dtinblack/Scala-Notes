[AdvancedScalaObjects](http://naildrivin5.com/scalatour/wiki_pages/AdvancedScalaObjects/) - describes the use of apply() and unapply() with examples, in particular pattern matching.

[Extractor Objects](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/extractor-objects.html) - simple example showing how apply() and unapply() works with reference to the return type for unapply().

[Real-World Scala: Dependency Injection (DI)](http://jonasboner.com/real-world-scala-dependency-injection-di/) - describes how tou use Dependency Injection with examples involving 'implicits'.
