# Scala - Notes

Using [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) to test out ideas for apps I have ran into various problems
which have highlighted my lack of understanding in the underlying concepts of the programming language. 
To solve the problems I spent a lot of time searching the web, reading books and playing with the code ( usually 
using [REPL](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/09/scala-tutorial-scala-repl-expressions.html) to quickly identify the source of the problem and developing solutions).

I have gathered together all of the pieces of information under general headings to both remind
myself of the solutions, and to help anybody else who runs into similar problems.
