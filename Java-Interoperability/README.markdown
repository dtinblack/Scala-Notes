# Scala Java Interoperability

The following information helped to write software used to access
Java libraries from Scala. 

# Background

The following information helped to develop the example software shown in the folders ( big thanks to all of the 
authors).

* [Chapter 29](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/combining-scala-and-java.html) from [Programming in Scala](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/index.html)
, First Edition which describes how Scala is translated to Java, and the use of Java annotations in Scala.
* Daniel Spiewak's Blog [Interop Between Java and Scala](http://www.codecommit.com/blog/java/interop-between-java-and-scala) which covers Classes,
Traits, etc with examples.
* Information from [Twitter School](https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/java.html) that covers Java 
interoperability with Scala, including details of Classes, Exceptions, Traits, Objects etc.
* [FAQ - Java Interoperability](http://www.scala-lang.org/old/faq/4) covering Scala and Java compatibility, and
accessing classes. 
* [Example](http://alvinalexander.com/scala/passing-scala-arrays-java-methods-code) of passing arrays back and forth between Scala and Java.
* [Description](http://blog.madhukaraphatak.com/converting-java-collections-to-scala/) of converting Java collections to Scala with examples.
