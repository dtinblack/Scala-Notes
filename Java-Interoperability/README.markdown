# Scala Java Interoperability

Sometimes we have to get access to Java Libraries, usually to save development time. Although it should be 
straight forward to use the interoperability aspects of Scala and Java very often problems arise due to a 
lack of understanding between the differences of some of the concepts used by the two programming languages. 
This note has taken the information from the sources below to produce the working example shown in the folder.



# Background

The following information helped to develop the example software shown in the folders ( big thanks to all of the 
authors).

* [Chapter 29](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/combining-scala-and-java.html) from [Programming in Scala, First Edition](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/index.html)
 which describes how Scala is translated to Java, and the use of Java annotations in Scala.
* Daniel Spiewak's Blog [Interop Between Java and Scala](http://www.codecommit.com/blog/java/interop-between-java-and-scala) which covers Classes,
Traits, etc with examples.
* Information from [Twitter School](https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/java.html) that covers Java 
interoperability with Scala, including details of Classes, Exceptions, Traits, Objects etc.
* [FAQ - Java Interoperability](http://www.scala-lang.org/old/faq/4) covering Scala and Java compatibility, and
accessing classes. 
* [Example](http://alvinalexander.com/scala/passing-scala-arrays-java-methods-code) of passing arrays back and forth between Scala and Java.
* [Description](http://blog.madhukaraphatak.com/converting-java-collections-to-scala/) of converting Java collections to Scala with examples.
