# Trees

A series of examples of Tree data structures:

* Basic Tree Structure - see Tree.
* Binary Search Tree ( from [Data Structures in Scala](http://www.slideshare.net/knoldus/data-structuresscala) ) - see BSTree.

* TO DO [elegant solution to compare 2 binary tree's, and returning false at the earliest time](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15706904/elegant-solution-to-compare-2-binary-trees-and-returning-false-at-the-earliest)
* TO DO [Merge binary trees in Scala](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23849602/merge-binary-trees-in-scala)

* TO DO [A basic, immutable Set in Scala](http://amitdev.github.io/coding/2014/01/20/Functional-Set/)

# Background

The following information helped to develop the example software shown in the folders ( big thanks to all of the 
authors):

* Basic Tree Data Structure

* [patterns.scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/52.html) - example of a tree.
* [Data structures in Scala](http://www.slideshare.net/knoldus/data-structuresscala) - includes an example of a Binary Tree. 
* [Change node in Scala case class tree](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9129671/change-node-in-scala-case-class-tree) - Stakoverflow solution to adding a new
node to a tree.

* Binary Tree

* [A Pretty Printer Algebra](http://www.scala-blogs.org/2009/04/combinators-for-pretty-printers-part-1.html) - starting point for the 
development of a pretty printer for a tree, and [How would you print out the data in a binary tree, level by level, starting at the top?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1104644/how-would-you-print-out-the-data-in-a-binary-tree-level-by-level-starting-at-t).  
* [Designing a Purely Functional Data Structure](http://vkostyukov.ru/posts/designing-a-pfds/) - a binary heap.


* R-Tree

* [Archery: an immutable R-Tree for Scala](http://making.meetup.com/post/64387936554/archery-an-immutable-r-tree-for-scala) and [GitHub Source](https://github.com/meetup/archery) 
- description of R-Tree data types and methods to manipulate the tree.
